TMIM (Too Much Information Movies)

Project Goal:

The goal of this project is to provide relevent information on a movie or TV show typed in by the user. This project will also produce a list of top 100 movies/series recommendations that the user can also pull information on.

Why is something like this needed?

When you hear about a movie/show on TikTok or any other social media platform, you are usually not given that much information on the movie, AND you only hear of the movie from one POV. Also, a lot of the time, I become aware of movies and TV shows through fan edits, so I only see specific clips of the movie/show and don't get any real information on it.

This code will allow a user to type the name of a movie or TV show and get all the information on it (genre, actors, rated, languages, awards, plot, ratings, length, streaming options, etc.) to see if they actually want to watch it or not.

The 'pip install IMDbPY' allows me to access the content in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb)

I pulled this code -- along with some of the other code I used later on -- from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-imdbpy-getting-title-from-searched-movie/

# Infographics

I was able to create both infographics using Canva and Sketchbook-Auto Desk

I used Canva to create everything except for the visual at the bottom, which I digitally drew in Sketchbook-Auto Desk.

# Medium Articles

For a class project, I puplished 2 articles to Medium describing principles UX designers should have when using AI for their work, and my process in using AI to develop wireframes.

# Wireframes

For a class project, we were given a client (Atomic Object) who wanted us to create a mobile app that gives users a VIP user experience at Detroit Tigers games.

This class focused on using AI etically with UX design, so I was able to create a wireframes of the app in Figma using differnt AI tools along with my own creative touch. My final wireframe designs will be posted to my Medium.

# Video Editing

I am a self-taught video editor of 4 years who uses Video Star (A mobile app for Apple devices). I make creative, expressive video edits and post them to a "Fan Page" I manage on TikTok and Instagram. This is something I like to do on my free time for fun, and I like to expirement with different styles and transitions.
